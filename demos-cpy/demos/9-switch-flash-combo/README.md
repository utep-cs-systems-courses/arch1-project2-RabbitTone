## Description
This program uses an interrupt to detect when a switch is pressed or
released.

The switch state is used to modify a blink pattern generated by the periodic interrupt.

## Suggested Activity

Implement multiple blink sequences.  Each successive button press
selects the next one.  Hint: add a blink sequence selector state var.
